# Machine-learning

In my Advanced Machine Learning course, implemented a Beta-Variational Autoencoder (Beta-VAE) in PyTorch, training it on the MNIST dataset to generate and analyse disentangled latent representations. Enhanced the model with conditional image generation and importance sampling, achieving effective visualization and interpretability of latent spaces.
